# Architecture Components
One step ahead than most of the available blog post of "Architecture Components", I have tried to develop bit more complete example using a use-case "User Management".

The goal is to achieve: <br />
-> ViewModel (Done) <br />
-> LiveData (Done) <br />
-> Room (Done) <br />
-> RecyclerView (Done) <br />
-> CardView (Done) <br />
-> Dagger 2 (Pending) <br />
-> Local unit tests (Pending) <br />
-> Instrumented tests (Pending)

Which I strongly believe are essentials building block of any android app.

# User Management
-> List of users (Done) <br />
-> Add user (Done) <br />
-> User's details (Pending) <br />
-> Edit User (Pending) <br />
-> Delete User (Pending) <br />
